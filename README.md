# kstar-decay-analysis
This is my project for my Physics laboratory-2 course at University of Bologna.
todo

## setting up jupyter
todo all this

also, todo this should prob be added as custom cmake/make command, not bothering
for now.

pipenv is required

pipenv install

you might want to trust this
pipenv run jupyter trust notebook-name.ipynb 

pipenv run jupyter-lab

all set. If on wsl, follow the link in console.
Otherwise, it should open by itself.


if there is a permission error on wsl, chown the crap outta it

note that root --notebook is bugged asf

also note that c++ root kernel is slow at loading. Have patience.


## Dependencies
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) (required, version 6.18^)
todo

## Running
This code was tested and running on _Mac OS X 10.14.6 Mojave_.
Please note that this is still WIP, I will update this section later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Additional notes
TBD
